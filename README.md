## üìñ Abstract
The efficacy and tissue specificity of RNA therapeutic tools is critical for their clinical translation. In this study, we conducted large-scale in vivo RNA structure profiling across four cell lines and systematically characterized how **target RNA secondary structure** and **RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)** influence CRISPR/Cas13d guide RNA (gRNA) activity.

We observed that structural dynamics across cell types can cause the same gRNA to exhibit divergent knockdown efficiency. RBPs, by stabilizing single-stranded regions, positively modulate gRNA function. Leveraging these insights and ‚àº290,000 published RfxCas13d screen data, we developed **SCALPEL**, a deep learning model that integrates:

- RNA sequence
- In vivo icSHAPE data
- RBP binding profiles
- Transcript expression levels
- Cell-type identity

SCALPEL significantly outperforms existing models and, more importantly, enables **cell type-specific prediction** of gRNA activity. Validation screens across diverse cell types further confirm the biological relevance of structural context in gRNA efficacy, paving the way for **precision RNA-targeting therapeutics**.
