## üìñ Abstract
The efficacy and tissue specificity of RNA therapeutics are critical for clinical translation. Here, by large-scale profiling of the dynamic RNA structurome across four cell lines, we systematically characterized the impact of **in vivo target RNA structure** and **RNA-protein interactions** on CRISPR/Cas13d gRNA activity. We identified the structural patterns of high-efficacy gRNA targets and observed that structural differences can lead to variations in efficacy across different cellular contexts. By stabilizing single-stranded structure, RNA-binding proteins also enhanced gRNA efficacy.

 Leveraging this cell context information, along with approximately 290,000 RfxCas13d screening data, we developed SCALPEL, a deep learning model that predicts gRNA performance across various cellular environments. SCALPEL integrates:

- **Both target and gRNA sequence**
- **In vivo icSHAPE data acorss different cell lines**
- **Cell type-specific RBP binding profiles**

SCALPEL significantly outperforms existing models, and, most importantly, enables **cell type-specific prediction** of gRNA activity. Validation screens across multiple cell lines demonstrate that cellular context significantly influences gRNA performance, even for identical targeting sequences, underscoring the feasibility of **cell type-specific knockdown** by targeting structural dynamic regions. SCALPEL can also facilitate designing highly efficient virus-targeting gRNAs and gRNAs that robustly knockdown maternal transcripts essential for early zebrafish development. Our method offers a novel approach to develop context-specific gRNAs, with potential to advance **tissue-** or **organ-specific** RNA therapies.
